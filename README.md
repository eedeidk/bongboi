# bongboi / টেলিবই
This repo contains bengali EPUB books which are out of copyright & available in Public Domains. Find all of them at https://t.me/bongboi

# Vision
📚 Bengali Community had very little source of ebooks (EPUBS), though rich in terms of PDFs. In the times of Corona - Lockdown, decided to build EPUBs from PUBLIC Domains like https://www.ebanglalibrary.com . 

👁️‍🗨️️ Although [rupkotha project](https://rupkotha.github.io) existed earlier but was abandoned (Due to lack of Volunteers !). Here is Ahmed Nazir's [repo](https://github.com/AhmedNazir/eBanglaLibrary). The project was further improved and remixed with other github repos like [Safaribooks](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/safaribooks) in many ways and made compatible to EPUB 3.0 by the course of time.

🥇️ First EPUB by [@bongboi](https://t.me/bongboi) was in the middle of May 2020. Then as of Oct 2020 around 2200 EPUBs are built. They are on [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/bongboi) and a sister channel [@kindlebengali](https://t.me/kindlebengali) for MOBIs. 

📰️ Later on @bongboi got some Volunteers. Though only four of them are active now. We expect more of the public to join us soon. In the mean time __Happy Reading__

🌟 We believe open knowledge source stimulates activity and progress in the arts for the intellectual enrichment of the public.
